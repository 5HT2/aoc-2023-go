# aoc-2023-go

These are my attempts at [AOC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023), I'm racing a friend while attempting each of these (we both start writing code once we're both ready).

Do note, this is my first year doing AOC, and I'm not really optimizing for the fastest or most efficient code, `day_2_a` probably has the most horrendous Go code I've written in a while. I might rewrite things later to be a bit cleaner.

## Time-to-write:

1. Day 1
    1. 23 min
    2. 52 min (we both fucked up and misunderstood the problem lol)
2. Day 2
    1. 38 min
    2. 9 min
